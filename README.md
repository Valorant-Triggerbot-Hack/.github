## 🔫 What Is a Triggerbot in Valorant?

Triggerbot is a cheat that auto-fires your weapon **the moment** an enemy model enters your crosshair. No need to click. It reads the pixel or model data, detects enemy presence, and pulls the trigger faster than human reflex.

Unlike aimbots, triggerbots keep your aim movement 100% natural — just silently take the shot when it counts. 👀
